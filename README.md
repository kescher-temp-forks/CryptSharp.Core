# CryptSharp Library for .NET (Core and newer)

This is a netstandard 2.0, netstandard 2.1, net5.0, net6.0, net7.0 version of the [CryptSharpOfficial](https://www.zer7.com/software/cryptsharp) library. No logic changes - contains bug fixes.

The original library is licensed under the ISC license, thus my changes are released under the same terms.

```
Install-Package CryptSharp.NET -Version 7.0.1
```

This library was forked from costinbanu/CryptSharp.Core but he didn't take my .NET 7 bug fix so I am maintaining a seperate repo and nuget package now. The nuget package is named [CryptSharp.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CryptSharp.NET).
